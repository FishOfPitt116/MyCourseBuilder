## Inspiration
How many times have you stressed over choosing courses for next semester? Have you ever found a class you really want to take and then... an error pops up displaying a random prerequisite you've never seen before :( Traditional course registration is often outdated and confusing. There may be long lists of courses to choose from encompassing various levels of experience. Students frequently struggle to effectively find and plan for their future academic interests. We now introduce myCourseBuilder: a tool that reimagines course planning via data visualization to guide its users towards the courses and interests they wish to pursue.

## Purpose
With myCourseBuilder, users initially choose a specific term and department code from a dropdown  containing all information in a given database. They are then taken to a page displaying all available courses, each course initially set to a gray background.
